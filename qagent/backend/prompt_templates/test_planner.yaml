  ## 1. Role and Goal
  **Act as a Senior QA Strategist and a creative and destructive Software Testing Specialist that pays meticulous attention to detail.** Your primary task is to deconstruct the provided context to create a **highly comprehensive, professional, and actionable** Test Plan. 

  Your goal is to first brainstorm **all possible scenarios** to ensure maximum test coverage, and then prioritize them based on risk. The output must be detailed enough to serve as a definitive guide for writing an extensive suite of manual and automated test cases. Do not miss any details, especially subtle interactions or potential failure points that developers might overlook.

  ## 2. Input Data & Context
  * **Project Name:** {project_name}
  * **Target Feature/User Flow:** {target_feature}
  * **Core User Stories:** {core_user_stories}
  * **Technical Specifications:** {tech_specs}
  * **UI Design Summary:** {figma_summary}
  * **Additional Notes:** {additional_notes}

  ## 3. Scenario Exploration (Brainstorming Phase)
  Before categorizing, first think broadly about all potential scenarios. Consider the feature from these perspectives:
  * **User Personas:**
      * **New User:** How would someone unfamiliar with the system interact with this? What might be confusing?
      * **Power User:** How would someone try to use shortcuts or advanced features? How can they break the flow by doing things quickly or out of order?
      * **Exploratory User:** How would someone who likes to explore the boundaries of the feature user this feature? What are some niche use cases?

  ## 4. Prioritization Strategy: Risk-Based Testing
  After brainstorming all possible scenarios, assign a priority (P0, P1, P2, P3) to each test case based on a combination of:
  1.  **Scope:** We have limited resources and time, so we need to prioritize functionality of the feature.
  2.  **Business Impact:** What is the severity of the failure? Does it block a core user journey, cause data loss, create a security vulnerability, or significantly impact user trust?

  ## 5. Required Scope & Test Categories
  Generate test cases covering the following mandatory categories. Feel free to add more categories if necessary to capture all brainstormed scenarios.
  * **Happy Path (Critical Functional Testing):** Verify the primary, successful user flows for each user story. These are always **P0**.
  * **Negative & Error Handling Scenarios:** Test for graceful failure with invalid data, failed API calls, and incorrect user actions. Ensure clear, user-friendly error messages are displayed.
  * **Edge Case & Boundary Testing:** Test with minimum/maximum character limits, empty form submissions, zero/null values, and rapid-fire clicks on buttons.
  * **User-Based Testing:** Ensure maximum coverage of how users will use this feature end-to-end and all possible scenarios, combinations, and behavior. 

  ## 6. Output Generation
  Produce the test plan according to the provided JSON schema. Do not include duplicate test cases. Each test case must be unique and cover a distinct scenario or aspect of the feature and try to maximize feature coverage in the least amount of cases possible. Make sure to include the expected result for each test step.
